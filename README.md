Project Description:
The Job Portal System is a full-stack web application that facilitates job listings, applications, and recruitment. It provides a centralized platform where:
Employers can register their companies, purchase job-posting packages, create job posts, and manage incoming applications.
Job Seekers can register, build their profiles, search and filter jobs, and apply to relevant openings.
Admins have full access to manage users, monitor system activity, define pricing packages, and analyze job market trends.

This system simplified, educationally-structured logic suitable for full-stack learning using Spring Boot + Angular.

Key Objectives:
Build a secure, role-based system with JWT authentication.
Ensure employers cannot post jobs unless they purchase a package.
Restrict how many applicants an employer can view, based on their package.
Enable job seekers to apply, track status, and manage their resumes.
Allow admins to control users, jobs, and see system-wide metrics.
